# LLM

This repository contains four branches, each dedicated to a specific DevOps project:

## Branches and Projects

1. **LLM - TP1:**
    - Manipulate a pre-trained language model to understand how it generates text and explore the process of tokenization and text generation.
   
2. **LLM - TP2:**
    - Building on TP1 with further complexity regarding Manipulating a pre-trained language model to understand how it generates text and exploring the processes of tokenization and text generation.

3. **LLM - TP3:**
    - Dive deeper into text generation by experimenting with advanced parameters such as temperature and top_k, and analyze their effects on output creativity and coherence while using a pre-trained language model like GPT-2.
