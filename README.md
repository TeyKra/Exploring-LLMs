# Lab 2 : Tokenization and Text Generation with more complexity

## Overview

Building on TP1 with further complexity, this lab exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience with pre-trained language models by exploring text tokenization and generation. You will gain insights into the process of tokenization, data normalization, and lemmatization, while also building a chatbot prototype capable of responding to user queries.
