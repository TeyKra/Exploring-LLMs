# Lab 3: Tokenization and Text Generation with Pre-Trained Language Models

## Overview

Building on previous exercises, this lab is designed to deepen your understanding of pre-trained language models by exploring text tokenization and generation with Hugging Face's Transformers library. You will learn to manipulate pre-trained models such as GPT-2, experiment with different generation parameters, and analyze their impact on text generation.
